The [Polygon Bug Bounty](https://immunefi.com/bounty/polygon/) program is focused on our smart contracts, and apps with a primary interest in the prevention of loss of user funds, either by direct draining of locked funds or social engineering attacks by redirecting users or forcing them to sign a transaction.
