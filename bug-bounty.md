The [[Polygon Bug Bounty]{.ul}](https://immunefi.com/bounty/polygon/)
program is focused on our smart contracts, and apps with a primary
interest in the prevention of loss of user funds, either by direct
draining of locked funds or social engineering attacks by redirecting
users or forcing them to sign a transaction.
